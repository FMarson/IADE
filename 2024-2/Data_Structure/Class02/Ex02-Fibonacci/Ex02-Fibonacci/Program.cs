Exercise 2: Fibonacci Sequence Calculation

Statement:

In this exercise, you must implement a function that calculates the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. The first numbers in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

You need to implement the calculation of the n-th Fibonacci number in three different ways:

1. Recursive: Implement a function that calls itself to calculate the Fibonacci number.


2. Iterative: Implement a function that uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci number.


3. Using Memoization: Implement a function that stores intermediate results to optimize the calculation of Fibonacci numbers.

Requirements:

- The function should handle invalid inputs (negative numbers) by returning an appropriate error or message.
- Each implementation must monitor the time taken for execution and print this time at the end.
- Demonstrate the execution of all three implementations with a practical example.
