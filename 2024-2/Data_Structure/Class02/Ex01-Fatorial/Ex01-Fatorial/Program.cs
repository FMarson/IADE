/*
Exercise 1: Factorial Calculation

Statement:

In this exercise, you must implement a function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer (n). The factorial of a number n is defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 to n, and is represented by n!. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

You need to implement the factorial calculation in three different ways:

1. Recursive: Implement a function that calls itself to calculate the factorial.


2. Iterative: Implement a function that uses a loop to calculate the factorial.


3. Using Memoization: Implement a function that stores intermediate results to optimize the factorial calculation.

Requirements:

- The function should handle invalid inputs (negative numbers) by returning an appropriate error or message.
- Each implementation must monitor the time taken for execution and print this time at the end.
- Demonstrate the execution of all three implementations with a practical example.
