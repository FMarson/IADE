Exercise 3: Maximum Common Divisor (MCD) Calculation

Statement:

In this exercise, you must implement a function that calculates the maximum common divisor (MCD) of two non-negative integers. The MCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder. For example, the MCD of 8 and 12 is 4.

You need to implement the MCD calculation in three different ways:

1. Recursive: Implement a function that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the MCD recursively.


2. Iterative: Implement a function that uses a loop to apply the Euclidean algorithm and calculate the MCD.


3. Free: Implement a function that calculates the MCD using another factorization method of two numbers.

Requirements:

- The function should handle invalid inputs (such as negative numbers or zero) by returning an appropriate error or message.
- Each implementation must monitor the time taken for execution and print this time at the end.
- Demonstrate the execution of all three implementations with practical examples using different pairs of numbers.
